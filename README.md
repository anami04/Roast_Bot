### Project Description
The **Roast Chatbot** is an interactive web application that engages users in humorous conversations by delivering personalized roasts based on their quirky answers. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it features a smooth conversational flow and a user-friendly design. Users enjoy a fun experience as the chatbot dynamically generates witty responses, making it a light-hearted entertainment tool. Future enhancements may include machine learning for tailored responses and expanded language support.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world saturated with overly serious conversations and mundane chatbots, the **Roast Chatbot** addresses the *ridiculous problem* of insufficient laughter in online interactions. Users are plagued by dull exchanges, leaving them craving humor and lighthearted banter. This chatbot boldly steps in to alleviate the absurdity of serious chat experiences by providing personalized roasts, ensuring users are both entertained and slightly offended in the best possible way. By transforming ordinary chats into hilarious roasts, the Roast Chatbot solves the imaginary crisis of joylessness in digital communication, one quip at a time!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the **Roast Chatbot**, the uninvited jester of online conversations! This app hilariously transforms boring chats into comedy gold by serving up personalized roasts based on user responses. It asks ridiculous questions like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite food that nobody else should ever try?‚Äù and follows up with a perfectly timed roast that leaves users laughing (or groaning). Instead of tackling serious issues, the Roast Chatbot brings joy back into digital interactions, proving that life‚Äôs too short not to have a little fun!
